## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Svelte Framework

### What I learned

I felt like using Svelete was a bit overkill for this project, but I found it extremely easy and straightforward to use. It helped where I needed to use Javascript. Making each piece of the website its own component certainly helped as well ensuring that each piece is stylized appropiately. 

I wanted to talk a bit about how neat Svelte is. I was easily able to change the website based off the screen width. Check this out:

```
{#if window.innerWidth >= 1440}
  <p id="discount-special">-25% discount</p>
{:else}
  <p id="discount-special">-25%</p>
{/if}
```

Same with the slider, I'm referencing a Javascript variable in my HTML. A big game changer if you ask me.

```
<script>
  let range = 16;

  function handleSlide() {
      range = this.value;
  }
</script>

<div class="price">
  <p id="big-money">${range.toString() + '.00'}</p>
  <p id="month">/ month</p>
</div>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I hope to continue using Svelte. I hope to do something a bit more ambitious with Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Customizing the input thumb](https://css-tricks.com/styling-cross-browser-compatible-range-inputs-css/) - I looked through so many examples and none were helping me until I found this resource. I'm not sure what made the gears start spinning but extracting bits here helped me get a better idea of what was happening.
- [Creating the toggle switch](https://danklammer.com/articles/simple-css-toggle-switch/) - Shoutout to Dan Klammer creating this straight forward toggle switch.
- [Using flex](flexboxfroggy.com) - I started using `display: flex` more in this project and I've finished the project faster by practicing on here.

Special thanks to ApplePieGiraffe on the Frontend Mentor Slack for providing guidance. For anyone out there worried about getting it right, here's some knowledge for you: 

**"Don't worry too much about your solution not matching up with the original design in the design preview perfectlyâ€”that isn't the main point of Frontend Mentor challenges and it's often a little more difficult and time-consuming than is worth it to get very accurate results."**

This has definitely helped me from pixel peeping to make sure it's just right.
